# greenwich-fitness-app

A mobile app built using Angular JS/Ionic Framework.

# Completed so far...

* Decided to use Ionic framework as it uses Angular, and styling is almost identical to that of a native app
* Reviews page added, can post new, upvote and downvote
* Added google maps

# Next...

* Style main heading
* Add notifications
* Host rails api on heroku to store data: reviews, etc.
